#### Assignment Description: Analyzing the Impact of Non-Medication Item Visibility on Customer Behavior
In this assignment, we are tasked with analyzing customer behavior for an online pharmacy. The company recently added a feature that allows customers to add non-medication items (such as vitamins, first-aid supplies, or other health products) to their cart during the checkout process.

#### The goal of this assignment is to:

Evaluate the Potential Impact of a Proposed Change: The Product Team plans to increase the visibility of this feature, expecting that 20% of customers will add non-medication items to their cart. We need to analyze the potential financial and behavioral impact of this change.

#### In this assignment, we will:

*  Analyze current customer behavior, such as how many customers currently add non-medication items and the average value of their orders.
*  Estimate the potential increase in revenue from this feature if the adoption rate of non-medication items increases to 20%.
*  Use SQL queries to analyze key data points and customer metrics, helping us understand how the proposed change might affect customer behavior and the companyâ€™s revenue.
